One of my favourite childhood games - Arcade Game, a two player game played with two paddles and a ball
Designed using Python using TurtleGraphics

**Functionalities**
  - Designed an arcade game with two paddles on the left and right and a ball.
  - The left paddle movement is controlled by S and W keys and the right paddle movement is controlled by up and down arrows.
  - The scorecard is maintained for both the players and the score is displayed on the graphic screen.
  - If the paddle doesn't hit the ball, the game restarts with new scorecard.
